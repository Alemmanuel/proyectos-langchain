# LangChain Programming Agent

Welcome to the **AI Programming Agent**! This project is a mind-blowing demonstration of how LangChain can be used to build an AI agent that helps you code, debug, and learn programming concepts. Experience the future of coding with an AI assistant by your side!

## ✨ Features
- 💻 **Code generation:** Get instant code snippets for any task.
- 🧠 **Debugging assistance:** The AI helps you find and fix bugs.
- 📚 **Learn programming:** Ask questions and get clear, AI-powered explanations.
- 🚀 **Streamlit interface:** Code, chat, and learn in your browser.
- 🔒 **Secure API integration:** Your API keys are safe with dotenv.
- 🛠️ **Easy to extend:** Add new languages, features, or tools with minimal effort.
