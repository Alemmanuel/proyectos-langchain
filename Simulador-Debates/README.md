# LangChain AI Debate Simulator

Welcome to the **AI Debate Arena**! This project is a spectacular demonstration of how AI agents can simulate debates, arguments, and discussions using LangChain. Witness the power of artificial intelligence as it takes on both sides of any topic!

## ✨ Features
- 🗣️ **AI-powered debates:** Watch as AI agents argue, reason, and debate on any topic.
- 🤖 **Multiple personalities:** Each agent has its own style and memory.
- 🚀 **Streamlit interface:** Real-time debate simulation in your browser.
- 🔒 **Secure API integration:** Your API keys are safe with dotenv.
- 🛠️ **Easy to extend:** Add new debate topics, agents, or rules with minimal effort.
